      <p>A treasure trove of natural wonders and historical edifices, Kollam is an enchanting town with backwaters and picturesque landscapes. Located 70kms away from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, Kollam is a commercial centre and home to India’s cashew producing industry. Popularly known as Quilon, it is often regarded as the gateway to the backwaters of Kerala. <br><br>

        It sits on the bank of the Ashtamudi Lake, hence, cruising along the Alappuzha route is one of the main highlights of the region. With a history dating back to the 9th century, Kollam was a prominent spice trading centre. It is one of the oldest ports in the Arabian Sea that lies on the southwest coast which was frequented by iconic merchants, missionaries and explorers including Marco Polo, Ibn Battuta, Vasco da Gama, Henrique Henriques and many more. Venture the lesser-known path, and this beautiful city on India’s Malabar Coast is sure to enchant you.</p>
